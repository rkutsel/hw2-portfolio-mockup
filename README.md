# [Personal Portfolio Page](https://rkutsel.github.io/krn/)

## Description

This is part of week 8 homework assignment. This includes major updates to my personal portfolio page. I used Bulma CSS framework cause I wanted to learn something new outside of the ones I already used. This is probably my favorite of them all cause it's geared towards developers and has solid documentation. [Live Page](https://rkutsel.github.io/krn/)

## User Story From Previous Assignment

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria From Previous Assignment

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
